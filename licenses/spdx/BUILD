"""license_kind()s for SPDX license identifiers."""

# This is a set of license_kind declarations based on the SPDX license
# identifiers.  See: https://spdx.org/licenses/
#
# Open source projects using one of these well known licenses may reference
# the license_kind targets here. For example, their BUILD file might contain:
#
#   package(default_applicable_licenses = [":license"])
#
#   license(
#       name = "license",
#       license_kinds = ["@rules_license//licenses/spdx:MIT-0"],
#       license_text = "LICENSE.txt",
#   )
#
# Organizations building custom compliance checks based on these licenses
# declarations can take several approaches to align the the package author's
# declaration that the package is under (let's say) an MIT-0 license with
# the conditions that organization believes are required by MIT-0.
#
# One technique might be to:
#   1. Vendor in @rules_license to your source code tree.
#   2. Modify the targets here to add conditions for your particular needs.
#   3. Add it as a local_repository() to your Bazel WORKSPACE.
#   3. As the SPDX license list evolves, and your dependencies start using new
#      licenses, add new license_kind rules to this copy.
# Another possible strategy might be to
#   1. maintain a private list of these license_kind declarations somewhere
#      in your source tree. Let's say //compliance/licenses/spdx/BUILD.
#   2. Automatically remap "@rules_license//licenses/spdx:" to
#      "//compliance/licenses/spdx:" when importing third party code.
#
# The choice of approach should be based on your individual philosoply of how
# you should bring dependencies into your code. If you build from downloaded
# packages then you might favor the first approach, because external deps
# can simply refer to @rules_pkg, and they will pick up your local copy.
# If you maintain your own  third_party directory of all your dependences,
# so that your WORKSPACE files are empty, you might favor the second.
